## Introduction

Hello, I am Arnau Lucena Cobo, and I welcome you to my personal research on how to make a Video Player for video games in Visual Studio, assigned by [Raysan](https://github.com/raysan5) in the Project 2 subject at the Video Game Design & Development Degree in CITM, UPC

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/TitoLuce/Video-Player-Research/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
