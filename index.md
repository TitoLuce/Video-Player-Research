## Introduction

Hello, I am Arnau Lucena Cobo, and I welcome you to my personal research on how to make a Video Player for video games in Visual Studio, assigned by [Raysan](https://github.com/raysan5) in the Project 2 subject at the Video Game Design & Development Degree in CITM, UPC.

### What is a Video Player

A video player is a kind of media player for playing back digital video data from media such as optical discs, as well as from files of appropriate formats such as MPEG, AVI, RealVideo & QuickTime. Many of the video players also support simple playback of digital audio and 3D playback of 2D video.

When it comes to video games, these are used to cinematically showcase situations that would not be efficiently shown through gameplay, or would otherwise bee too complex to process in real time, and are especially useful to impress the players by showcasing animation prowess, and help expand the creative options one has to convey emotions or ideas.

### Types of cutscenes in videogames

There are a total of five types of cutscenes used in video games:

- Live-action Cutscenes

Live-action cutscenes have many similarities to films, using constructed sets & actors to portray the characters. And some games, such as Electronic Arts' Lord of the Rings & Star Wars games have extensively used film footage & other assets from the film production in their cutscenes.

- Pre-rendered cutscenes

Pre-rendered cutscenes are animated and rendered by the game's developers, and take advantage of the full array of techniques of CGI, cel animation or graphic novel-style panel art.

-Real time cutscenes 
Real time cutscenes are rendered on-the-fly using the same game engine as the graphics during gameplay. This technique is also known as Machinima/Machinema.

These are usually of much lower quality than pre-rendered cutscenes, but can adapt to the game's state.
